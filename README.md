# PoseInvariantFaceRecognition

Pose Invariant Face Recognition upto +-70 degree of yaw using PCA

◦ Projected frontal view of image, rendering 3D model to detect facial parts using shared pool of parts, and compares them 
  with database.
  
◦ Detected faces with 92% accuracy and with lack of illumination algorithm’s recognition rate was 85%.

◦ Selected for IEEE International Conference on Imaging System and Techniques held in Krakow, Poland.
