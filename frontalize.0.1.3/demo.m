% DEMO script for frontalizing faces, based on the method described in [1]
% This demo produces a frontalized face for the image test.jpg
%
% If you find this code useful and use it in your own work, please add
% reference to [1] and, if appropriate, any of the other papers mentioned below.
%
% Dependencies: 
%   The demo uses the following dependencies. You MUST have these installed and
%   available on the MATLAB path:
%   1. calib function available from [2,3], required for estimating the query
%       camera projection matrix, C_Q. Calib functions are assumed to be
%       under folder <frontalization>/calib
%  2. Facial feature detection functions. The demo provides examples
%      of frontalization using different facial landmark detection methods. Currently supported are:
%	  - SDM [4] (default, used in paper; IMPORTANT: We cannot provide code for this method, if you do 
%		not have it available, please use other alternatives listed below), 
%	  - The facial feature detector of Zhu and Ramanan [5]
%	  - DLIB detector (implementing the method of Kazemi and Sullivan) [6]. 
%	  - Any sparse (five-point) facial landmark detector. Landmarks are the two centers of the eyes, the tip 
%		of the nose and the two corners of the mouth. See [7] for one such detector and references therein.
%       Note: this option is currently interactive, allowing the user to
%       select the five landmarks manually.
%	  Please see the script facial_feature_detection.m on how to use these (as well as 
%     edit paths to the detector used in practice, in case these differ from 
%     the ones in the script). See the function makeNew3DModel.m in case
%     a different facial feature detector is used.
%   3. OpenCV required by calib for calibration routines and some of the
%       detectors for cascase classifiers (e.g., SDM)
